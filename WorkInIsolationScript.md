# Script for clipchamp based video project

## Intro

*Work in Isolation* is a technique I use to
quickly produce example code for my collaborators.

I keep my coding environment *nearby* so I can
share code that "compiles" and "run".

This is often key to helping someone make progress
on their work.

It includes the creation of proof of concept code
that demonstrates a specific technique or use of an API
or library.

This approach makes it more likely that your technical direction
will be useful and insist on a good understanding of the problem.

It avoids sening people in the wrong direction or into a dead end.

### Flow

The isolated environment is ideal for writing new code.

The projects are small and build quickly, for most, inner loop
times are seconds. Test projects, are used to collect samples
in test methods. Test classes for each sample area helps
organize the code. Test Explorer is the UI intefaces to these
samples so you can run them and observe the results.

Isoation enables the ability to execute coding workflows freely

write code, run tests, and commit in a tight look. when done, push.
This loop, when it works well enables the flow states that we are seeking.

In the text experience, the confort of a wall of green showing things work
can be very satisfyiing.

## Setup

I'm going to show an example of this technique

through the use a project I created to

demonstrate how to work on WinRT based designs

for a team mate.
