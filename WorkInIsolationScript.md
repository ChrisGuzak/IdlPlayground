# Script for clipchamp based video project

## Intro

Work in isolation is a technique I use to

quickly produce example code for my team mates.

I keep my coding environment near by so I can
create proof of concept code snippets, using
a specific technique, library function or api.

being able to produce code that "compiles" and even
"run" is often key to helping someone make progress
on their work.

This approach helps avoid suggesting solutions that
are not workable or that mis-understand the problem.

### Flow

The isolated environment is ideal for writing new code.

The inner loop times are seconds and

the approach creates the comfort of test driven development

the ability to execute coding workflows freely

write code, run tests, and repeat that loop to make steady progress through
the problem that you are solving.

and the comforting wall of green.

commit and push to share the examples with others.

## Setup

I'm going to show an example of this technique

through the use a project I created to

demonstrate how to work on WinRT based designs

for a team mate.
