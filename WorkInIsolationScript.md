# Script for clipchamp based video project

## Intro

Work in isolation is a technique I use to

keep coding environments near by so I can

quickly produce example code for my communities
and team mates.

this technique also produces the ideal environment for
writing new code.

inner loop times in a few seconds and
the comforts of test driven development

## Setup

I'm going to show an example of this technique

through the use a project I created to

demonstrate how to work on WinRT based designs

for a team mate.
